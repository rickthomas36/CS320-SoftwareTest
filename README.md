# CS320-SoftwareTest

How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

Functional Testing:
Perform unit testing for individual components using frameworks like JUnit (Java), PyTest (Python), or Jest (JavaScript).
Security Measures:
Validate user inputs to prevent injection attacks
Automation:
Integrate testing into CI/CD pipelines with tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or Azure DevOps to ensure continuous quality.
Monitoring and Logging:
Use monitoring tools to detect anomalies in production.
Set up robust logging and alerting for early detection of functional or security issues.


How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

Understand the User:
Conduct interviews, surveys, or focus groups to gather user requirements.
Build personas to represent key user groups and their goals.
Translate Needs into Features:
Use user stories to document requirements.
Prioritize features using frameworks like MoSCoW (Must-have, Should-have, Could-have, Won’t-have).


How do I approach designing software?

Understand the Problem:
Define clear objectives for the software and identify constraints (e.g., performance, scalability, budget).
Design Principles:
Follow SOLID principles for maintainable and scalable code.
Ensure modularity, reusability, and separation of concerns.
High-Level Design:
Use design methodologies like UML diagrams to model the architecture.
Decide on a design pattern (e.g., MVC, Microservices, Event-driven) that suits the application’s requirements.
